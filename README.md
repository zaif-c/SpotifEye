## Overview

**SpotifEye** is a full-stack web application that connects to a user's Spotify account and visualizes their listening habits using **FastAPI** (Python) and **React** (TypeScript). The app provides access to top tracks and favorite artists with customizable time ranges, offering insights into your music preferences.

---

## Problem Statement

Spotify offers limited insights beyond basic playback history. Users lack control over timeframe filters and have no way to analyze their listening patterns in detail. Annual features like Spotify Wrapped are fun but not interactive or customizable.

**SpotifEye bridges that gap**, empowering users with:
- Custom timeframe-based stats (4 weeks, 6 months, all time)
- Real-time access to top tracks and artists
- Clean, modern interface for viewing your music preferences

---

## Core Features

### Backend (FastAPI)
- Spotify OAuth 2.0 authentication with secure token management
- REST API endpoints:
  - Fetch top tracks (`/top-tracks`)
  - Fetch top artists (`/top-artists`)
  - Get user profile (`/me`)

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- Modern, responsive UI using Mantine
- Secure login with Spotify
- Display of top artists/tracks with three time ranges:
  - Short term (4 weeks)
  - Medium term (6 months)
  - Long term (all time)
- Clean card-based layout for tracks and artists
- Secure session management

---

## Future Scope

### Planned Features
- Audio feature visualizations (danceability, energy, valence, tempo)
- Song recommendations based on listening history
- More detailed artist statistics
- Playlist analysis
- Custom date range selection
- Export functionality for statistics
