# SpotifEye: Your Spotify Listening Dashboard

## Overview

**SpotifEye** is a full-stack web application that connects to a user's Spotify account and visualizes their listening habits using **FastAPI** (Python) and **React** (JavaScript). The app provides real-time access to top tracks, favorite artists, and detailed audio feature breakdowns such as energy, danceability, and mood â€” insights not available in Spotify's native app.

---

## Problem Statement

Spotify offers limited insights beyond basic playback history. Users lack control over timeframe filters and have no way to analyze track characteristics (e.g., energy, mood, tempo). Annual features like Spotify Wrapped are fun but not actionable or interactive.

**SpotifEye bridges that gap**, empowering users with:
- Custom timeframe-based stats
- Audio feature visualizations
- Real-time, interactive data from their listening history

## Core Features

### Backend (FastAPI)
- Spotify OAuth 2.0 authentication (access + refresh token flow)
- REST API endpoints to:
  - Fetch top tracks (`/top-tracks`)
  - Fetch top artists (`/top-artists`)
  - Retrieve audio features of tracks (`/audio-features`)
  - Get song recommendations (`/recommendations`) - Optional

### Frontend (React)
- Login with Spotify
- Display of top artists/tracks (short, medium, long term)
- Interactive bar or radar charts showing:
- Danceability, energy, valence, tempo, etc.
- Song recommendations display (Optional)
